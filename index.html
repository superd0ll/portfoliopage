    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> <em>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
        and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
        and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
        of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
        or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
        circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
        except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a
        man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
        who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</em>
